# Excel-Challenge
Excel analysis of KickStarter project data.

Was given an Excel dataset and after analyzing the data the following questions were answered:

1.  What are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
The theatre category had the greatest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns for the data provided. Interestingly enough, theatre also had the highest number of failed campaigns.
Conversely, journalism had the least amount of any state of campaign attributed to it with only 24 canceled Kickstarter campaigns.
Overall, the month of May was the most successful month for all Kickstarter campaigns.

2.  What are some limitations of this dataset? 
o  One of the limitations of this dataset is that it is incomplete with regards to time. We are only provided with 9 years of data, which is limited. Another limitation is we have no information about spotlight and staff pick and it is largely excluded from any kind of analysis. Finally, the last limitation is how difficult it is to see a correlation between percent funded and whether the campaign was successful.

3.  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
o  A map chart could be created to help show what preferences each country had towards the different categories of campaigns.
o  A histogram could help illustrate if there is a correlation between percent funded and if the campaign was successful or failed. The four states would be the x-axis and the average percent funded could be the y-axis.
